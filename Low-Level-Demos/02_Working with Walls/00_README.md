# Welcome to Working with Walls!

These lessons will build on the basic knowledge already accumulated, and bring in properties of __real physical elements__. As the title suggests we'll be focusing our attention on __walls__, but throughout these lessons we'll discuss how elements of walls can be __extrapolated__ to a variety of __other haptic environments__.

## Recommended Order

You'll find that these lessons build on eachother quite a bit, as we'll be starting with a basic wall and messing with the parameters as we go on. WIth that in mind, see below for the recommeded lesson order -
