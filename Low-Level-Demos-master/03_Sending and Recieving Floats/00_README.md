# Sending and Recieving Floats

This is a brief intermission of working with the Haplet to a quick lesson series on some very useful functions; we'll use them in later lessons. The gist of this is to send floats back and forth between the Processing "side" and Arduino "side" with as much numerical precision as possible. The two lessons below will outline the functions utilized to do this -
