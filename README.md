# Haply Arduino Firmware

## How To Use This Repository
In this repository you'll find the relevent firmware for the Haply Boards. Depending on what board you have you'll use a different firmware to use the Haply APIs.

See the API - specific repository for which firmware to use.

## Low Level Demos
Low Level Demos is a series of lessons based around the firmware of the Haply boards. The lessons use the Arduino IDE and Processing, and go through the basics of how haptic signals are sent and received in the Haplet - this is what the API does!
